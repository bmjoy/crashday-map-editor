# crashday 3D map editor
Crashday 3D editor made with unity.  
Current unity version: 2018.1.0b13

## HOW-TO setup
1. go to your crashday's data folder
 * steamapps/common/crashday/data/
2. You need to extract data000, 002, 005, 006 cpk's to this folder, so it will look like
 crashay/data/content/ ~files~
3. Additinally you can install mods by finding their archives and unzipping them too (Highly untested!)
4. Launch the editor!

## Current TODO list
1. ~~Heightmaps loading~~(done)
 * Some tiles still have holes when connecting
2. ~~Texture loading~~(partialy done)
 * Needs correct UV loading
3. ~~Adding tile tools~~
4. Adding terrain tools
5. Optimisations
 * Research C# collections to faster load maps (FindIndex takes too long when loading maps)
6. Better Mod tiles support
7. Fix stupid stuff
8. ~~Better controls~~
9. Mobile version?
10. Move objects and CPs after map resize
 * CPs are moved now, but not tested for bugs
